# Subscription Workflows & Landing Page Implementation

## Overview
This document describes the complete implementation of backend workflows for payments, subscriptions, invoices, and renewals, along with a modern landing page for the WhatsApp Bot platform.

## Backend Workflows

### 1. Subscription Workflow Utilities (`packages/trpc/src/utils/subscription-workflow.ts`)

#### Key Features:
- **Free Plan Support**: Automatically activates free plans without requiring payment
- **Paid Plan Workflow**: Creates invoices and payment records for paid plans
- **Subscription Creation**: Handles subscription creation with feature initialization
- **Renewal Automation**: Automates subscription renewals with invoice generation
- **Payment Processing**: Completes payments and activates subscriptions
- **WebSocket Integration**: Emits real-time events for all workflow steps

#### Main Functions:

##### `createSubscriptionWithWorkflow()`
- Validates plan availability and status
- Calculates subscription periods based on billing cycle
- Handles trial periods
- **Free Plans**: Sets status to "active" immediately, skips payment
- **Paid Plans**: Sets status to "pending", creates invoice and payment records
- Copies plan features to subscription
- Initializes usage tracking
- Emits socket events

##### `renewSubscriptionWithWorkflow()`
- Calculates new billing period
- Resets usage counters
- **Free Plans**: Renews immediately without payment
- **Paid Plans**: Generates renewal invoice and payment
- Emits renewal events

##### `cancelSubscriptionWithWorkflow()`
- Supports immediate cancellation or at period end
- Updates subscription status appropriately
- Emits cancellation events

##### `completePaymentForSubscription()`
- Updates payment status to "completed"
- Marks invoice as "paid"
- Activates pending subscriptions
- Emits success events

### 2. Updated Routers

#### Subscriptions Router (`packages/trpc/src/routers/subscriptions.ts`)
- Integrated workflow utilities into create, renew, and cancel mutations
- Simplified code by delegating complex logic to workflow utilities
- Returns complete workflow results (subscription, invoice, payment, isFree flag)

#### Payments Router (`packages/trpc/src/routers/payments.ts`)
- Added socket event emissions for all payment state changes
- Added `completePayment` mutation for subscription workflow integration
- Emits events: `payment_created`, `payment_succeeded`, `payment_failed`, `payment_refunded`

#### Invoices Router (`packages/trpc/src/routers/invoices.ts`)
- Added socket event emissions for invoice operations
- Emits events: `invoice_created`, `invoice_updated`, `invoice_paid`
- Fixed TypeScript errors with proper error handling

### 3. WebSocket Events Integration

All workflow operations emit real-time socket events to notify users:
- **Subscription Events**: created, updated, cancelled, renewed
- **Payment Events**: created, succeeded, failed, refunded
- **Invoice Events**: created, updated, paid

## Technical Implementation Details

### Type Safety
- All workflows are strongly typed
- Proper TypeScript interfaces for all data structures
- Error handling with TRPCError for consistent API responses

### Database Operations
- Transactional integrity for complex workflows
- Proper foreign key relationships
- Cascade deletes where appropriate
- Usage tracking initialization

### Error Handling
- Validation at every step
- Meaningful error messages
- Proper HTTP status codes via TRPC
- Rollback support for failed operations

### Real-time Updates
- WebSocket events for immediate UI updates
- Tenant-specific event broadcasting
- Payload includes relevant data for UI rendering

## Usage Examples

### Create Free Subscription
```typescript
const result = await trpc.subscriptions.create.mutate({
  tenantId: "tenant-uuid",
  planId: "free-plan-uuid",
});
// Result: { subscription, invoice: null, payment: null, isFree: true }
// Subscription is immediately active
```

### Create Paid Subscription
```typescript
const result = await trpc.subscriptions.create.mutate({
  tenantId: "tenant-uuid",
  planId: "pro-plan-uuid",
});
// Result: { subscription, invoice, payment, isFree: false }
// Subscription is "pending" until payment completed
```

### Complete Payment
```typescript
const result = await trpc.payments.completePayment.mutate({
  id: "payment-uuid",
  transactionId: "gateway-transaction-id",
});
// Activates pending subscription
// Marks invoice as paid
// Emits success events
```

### Renew Subscription
```typescript
const result = await trpc.subscriptions.renew.mutate({
  id: "subscription-uuid",
});
// Calculates new period
// Resets usage counters
// Creates invoice for paid plans
// Emits renewal event
```

## Future Enhancements

### Payment Gateway Integration
The system is designed to integrate payment gateways:
1. Update `completePaymentForSubscription()` to process gateway responses
2. Add webhook handlers for payment gateway callbacks
3. Implement payment gateway-specific logic in mutations
4. Add retry logic for failed payments

### Suggested Gateways:
- **Stripe**: Global payments, subscriptions support
- **PayPal**: Wide adoption, easy integration
- **Paddle**: Handles VAT, merchant of record
- **Local Gateways**: Region-specific options (PayMob for MENA, etc.)

### Additional Features:
- Proration for plan upgrades/downgrades
- Discount codes and promotions
- Usage-based billing
- Annual billing with discounts
- Invoice email notifications
- Payment reminder system
- Dunning management for failed payments

## Testing Recommendations

### Unit Tests
- Test each workflow function independently
- Mock database calls
- Verify event emissions
- Test edge cases (expired subscriptions, invalid plans)

### Integration Tests
- Test complete workflows end-to-end
- Verify database state after operations
- Test WebSocket event delivery
- Test concurrent operations

### E2E Tests
- Test user journey from signup to subscription
- Test payment completion flow
- Test renewal process
- Test cancellation scenarios

## Deployment Notes

### Environment Variables
Ensure these are set for production:
- Database connection strings
- Payment gateway API keys (when implemented)
- WebSocket server configuration
- Email service credentials (for invoices)

### Database Migrations
Run migrations to ensure schema is up-to-date:
```bash
bun run db:migrate
```

### Monitoring
Monitor these metrics:
- Subscription creation success rate
- Payment completion rate
- Renewal success rate
- Invoice generation time
- WebSocket event delivery latency
